ikanow.data.browser
===================

Sample application that demonstrates how to query the IKANOW Developer API 
and develop analytical value from the data queried using tools like the
Google Maps Javascript API.

Note: To use a local copy of this application you will need to edit the apiKey and 
googleApiKey variables in settings.js (found in the lib folder). Your apiKey value 
is assigned to you when you register to use the developer.ikanow.com
portal. You can get a key for Google Maps at https://developers.google.com/maps/signup.

Without these keys your local copy of the application will not work.

It is also important to note that for the data.browser app to return data
you need to join the following communities: Automotive News, Bicycling News, Political News,
and News. Information on how to join communities can be found here:
